Problem 36: Double-base palindromes
The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than n, whereas 1000 ≤ n ≤ 1000000, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)
