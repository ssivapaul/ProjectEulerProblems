Problem 70: Totient permutation
Euler's Totient function,  ϕ(n)
  (sometimes called the phi function), is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine,  ϕ(9)=6
 . The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so  ϕ(1)=1
 .

Interestingly,  ϕ(87109)=79180
 , and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Find the value of n, 1 < n < limit, for which  ϕ(n)
  is a permutation of n and the ratio  nϕ(n)
  produces a minimum.

function totientPermutation(limit) {

  return true;
}

totientPermutation(10000);
