Problem 37: Truncatable primes
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only n (8 ≤ n ≤ 11) primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

Tests
Waiting:1. truncatablePrimes(8) should return a number.
Waiting:2. truncatablePrimes(8) should return 1986.
Waiting:3. truncatablePrimes(9) should return 5123.
Waiting:4. truncatablePrimes(10) should return 8920.
Waiting:5. truncatablePrimes(11) should return 748317.
